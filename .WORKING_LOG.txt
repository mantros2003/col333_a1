Cuurently restricting problem to a single helicopter single village trip

:TODO:  - Think about how to add stochasticity to the problem, especially in resource allocation as all possible combinations of resource allocation can;t be explored(?)

        - Currently we just visit a village once, and we do not check whether we actually fulfilled the requirements, change it to update the village's help requirement status only when fulfilling it's need is costly.
