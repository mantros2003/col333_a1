Cuurently restricting problem to a single helicopter single village trip

:TODO:  - Think about how to add stochasticity to the problem, especially in resource allocation as all possible combinations of resource allocation can;t be explored(?)

        - [done] Update solve-lp to consider the constraints such that it consider the helpt needed, instead of hard 9n constraint, change it to 9n-help_provided, and n-help_provided for other supplies

        - [done] Refactor the code according to the changes in the struct

        - decouple the expand function, output the vector of the index of the village

        -[done] Rename the parent_state to current_state

        - update the G cost function to add the lp solver function
